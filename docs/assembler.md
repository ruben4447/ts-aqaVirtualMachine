## Operands
These follow an instruction and are seperated by whitespace (a comma is optional)
*e.g. MOV r8, #5*

Operands take many forms:

### Constant
Any value prefixed by a `#` is constant.
SYNTAX: `#[base]<number>`
- **optional** `base` : base of number. May be one of the following:
  - `b` : binary (base 2)
  - `o` : octal (base 8)
  - `d` : decimal (base 10) **[DEFAUlT]**
  - `x` : hexadecimal (base 16)
- `number` : the value of the constant. If decimal, value may contain a decimal point. Else, the value will be parsed as an integer.

### Register
A register is a single location to store datum in
SYNTAX: `<register>`
The registers depend in the Processor.

### Address
Points to a location in memory.
